## 🌟 Executive Summary  

Retailers face a persistent challenge: **balancing inventory**.  
- Overstocking ties up capital and increases storage costs.  
- Stockouts lead to lost sales, frustrated customers, and damaged reputation.  
- Manual forecasting (Excel sheets, gut-feel decisions) is error-prone and reactive.  

**Smart Inventory AI Pro** solves this problem with a **modular, explainable AI system** that delivers:  
- 📈 Accurate demand forecasts  
- 📦 Optimized reorder points and safety stock  
- 🔍 Anomaly detection for unusual sales patterns  
- 💡 Business-friendly insights that drive smarter decisions  

The impact: **higher profitability, reduced waste, and improved customer satisfaction** — all in a lightweight, plug-and-play solution.

## 🛒 The Retail Inventory Problem  

Retail shop owners often struggle with:  
- **Overstocking** → Capital locked in unsold goods  
- **Stockouts** → Lost revenue and customer churn  
- **Manual Forecasting** → Time-consuming, error-prone spreadsheets  
- **Complex ERP Systems** → Expensive, hard to implement, overkill for small shops  
- **Basic Dashboards** → Show past sales but lack predictive intelligence

## 🚀 How Smart Inventory AI Pro is Different  

| Existing Solutions | Limitations | Smart Inventory AI Pro Advantage |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Excel sheets | Manual, error-prone | Automated AI forecasting |
| ERP systems | Costly, complex | Lightweight, modular, easy to deploy |
| Sales dashboards | Historical only | Predictive + prescriptive insights |

**Key Differentiators:**  
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Forecasting** (ensemble methods for robust accuracy)  
- 💡 **Explainable Insights** (business-friendly recommendations)  
- ⚡ **Lightweight Deployment** (Streamlit-based, runs locally or in cloud)  
- 📂 **Plug-and-Play CSV Upload** (no complex integrations required)  
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** (easy to extend, customize, and scale)  

---

## 💼 Why This Matters  

- **Profitability Boost**: Reduce capital lock-in and avoid costly stockouts.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate forecasting and inventory planning.  
- **Accessibility**: Designed for small and medium retailers, not just enterprises.  
- **Scalability**: Works for single shops or multi-store chains.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

Smart Inventory AI Pro follows a **modular, layered design**:  

- **Frontend (Streamlit)** → Interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- **Models Layer** → Forecasting, anomaly detection, inventory optimization  
- **Explainability Layer** → Business insights and recommendations  
- **Utilities Layer** → Data loaders, helpers, validation  
- **Config Layer** → Themes, styling, customization  

This separation of concerns ensures **maintainability, extensibility, and clean interfaces**.

## 🤖 AI & ML Techniques  

- **Ensemble Forecasting**: EWMA, Linear Regression, Seasonal Decomposition  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical + IQR-based methods with severity scoring  
- **Safety Stock Optimization**: Dynamic calculations based on demand volatility  
- **Reorder Point Logic**: Lead time + demand variability for smarter replenishment  

---

## 🎯 For Retailers (Simple Value Proposition)  

- No more guessing stock levels.  
- No more losing sales because of empty shelves.  
- No more wasting money on excess inventory.  

👉 Just upload your sales CSV, and let Smart Inventory AI Pro tell you **what to order, when, and how much**.

## 📂 Dataset Usage  

To make testing and evaluation easier, a ready-to-use kaggle dataset is included in the **`dataset/`** folder.  

This dataset allows you to:  
- Instantly explore forecasting features  
- Test anomaly detection  
- Validate inventory optimization logic  
- Understand dashboard visualizations  

You can either:  
1. Use the built-in AI-generated sample data inside the app  
2. Upload the provided dataset from the `dataset/` folder  
3. Upload your own retail sales CSV file  

### 📑 Expected CSV Format  

```csv
date,product_id,units_sold
2024-01-01,PROD001,45
2024-01-02,PROD002,52
2024-01-03,PROD003,48
```
